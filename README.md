# SlackRoller - Roll dice on Slack!
SlackRoller is a Slack app (currently in progress) for rolling dice on Slack. Currently it's designed to handle the slash command `/roll` as follows.

    /roll <die notation>

Where `<die_notation>` is the format `ndm` where `n` is the number of dice you want to roll, `d` is the literal letter "d" and `m` is the number of sides on the dice rolled. So If you wante dto roll a single six sided die, you would use the command `/roll 1d6`.
